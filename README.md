# 🛡️ S.C.O.U.T. Roblox (v1.56.0)

**S.C.O.U.T. Roblox** is a lightweight, community-driven browser extension designed to keep Roblox players safe. It automatically scans profiles, friend networks, and community groups to detect associations with known NSFW/ERP (Erotic Roleplay) networks. 

This extension is a part of the **[S.C.O.U.T. Ecosystem](https://scout-system.onrender.com/)**.

Made by the community, for the community. Stay safe.

## ✨ New in v1.56.0
* **Dedicated Scam Detection:** Added a new threat vector (`SCAM`) to identify accounts involved in phishing and cookie-logging (e.g., fake 3D avatar art commissions). Scammers are marked with a distinct yellow warning badge to differentiate them from NSFW threats.
* **Smart Profile Badges:** The main profile safety badge now prioritizes database intelligence. If a user has 0 flagged groups but was caught by the Autonomous System or manually logged, the badge will accurately display "DATABASE FLAGGED" or "FLAGGED SCAM" instead of "SAFE".
* **Community Guidelines Disclaimer:** Introduced a one-time Terms & Conditions popup upon first use to clarify the extension's purpose, acknowledge the possibility of false flags, and enforce a strict anti-harassment policy.

## ✨ Core Features
* **Main Profile Scanning:** Safety rating badges displayed directly on profile headers.
* **Intelligent Network Scanner:** Automatically detects flagged users within a target's friend list.
* **Dangerous User Warning:** Global warning system for users logged as "Dangerous" by the S.C.O.U.T. autonomous system.
* **Threat Intelligence Pop-ups:** Get detailed reports on detection vectors (Manual, Pulse Crawl, Deep Crawl) on demand.
* **Utility Tool**: Right-click to copy IDs for Users, Groups, Games, and Assets.

## 🛠️ Technical Upgrades (v1.55.0 - v1.56.0)
* **API Scaling:** Switched to the `/friends/find` paginated endpoint to support up to 1,000 friends, ensuring deep network transparency.
* **Circuit Breaker & Fallback:** Integrated a robust retry-with-backoff system and a secondary Render-hosted fallback node to bypass Cloudflare rate limits during heavy network scans.
